------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.05    Date: 1998/02/18 17:34:49

* Changed wording of Copyright to mention the Perl Artistic Licence rather
  than "the same terms as Perl itself".

* Moved ENDOFARGS default from _configure() (which may not get called)
  into new() (which always does).  Prevents an "Undefined variable..." 
  warning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.06    Date: 1998/03/20 10:33:25

* Fixed a problem with Makefile.PL which was preventing the man page for
  App::Config.pm from being extracted from Config.pm.  MakeMaker ignores
  any files that look like Configure.pm and Config.pm comes close enough.
  Fixed by explicitly adding MAN3PODS line to config hash.

* Minor documentation updates.
